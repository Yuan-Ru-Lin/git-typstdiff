# git-typstdiff

Lightweight tool to generate a Typst-formatted diff between two Git revisions of a `.typ` file, with insertions underlined in blue and deletions struck through in red.

## Features

* Compares any two Git revisions (tags, branches, commits) of a Typst file
* Highlights additions with `#insert[…]` (blue underline)
* Marks deletions with `#delete[…]` (red strikethrough)
* Supports a single-file workflow for simplicity
* No external dependencies beyond Python 3.6+, Git, and Typst

## Installation

Using **uv**:

```bash
uv install .
```

Or with **pip**:

```bash
pip install git-typstdiff
```

## Usage

```bash
git-typstdiff <rev1> <rev2> path/to/file.typ -o diff.typ
# e.g.
git-typstdiff HEAD~1 HEAD paper.typ -o paper-diff.typ
```

Then compile with Typst:

```bash
typst compile paper-diff.typ
```

## Development & Testing

```bash
uv install -e .       # editable install
pytest                 # run tests (if any)
```
